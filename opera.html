    <h3>The Pirates of Penzance</h3>
    <h4>ACT-1 Scene.-</h4>
       <p> <h5>(A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
        distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
        Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
        cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
        natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
        curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered â€” some drinking,
        some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
        one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
        seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
        kneels at his feet.)</h5></p>
     <h6 class="name">ALL:</h6>       
     <p class="song ALL">Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;<br>
        Fill, O fill the pirate glass;<br>
        And, to make us more than merry<br>
        Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>
    <h6 class="name">SAM:</h6>
    <p class="song SAM">For today our pirate 'prentice<br>
        Rises from indentures freed;<br>
        Strong his arm, and keen his scent is<br>
        He's a pirate now indeed!</p>
    <h6 class="name">FRE:</h6>    
    <p class="speech FRE"> I say I think it is; that is my impression.  But as I
        have never had an opportunity of comparing you with
        other women, it is just possible I may be mistaken.</p>
     <h6 class="name">KAT:</h6>   
    <p class="speech KAT">But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
        alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
        beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.</p>  
    <h6 class="name">KIN:</h6>  
    <p class="speech KIN"> Oh, better far to live and die<br>
        Under the brave black flag I fly,<br>
        Than play a sanctimonious part<br>
        With a pirate head and a pirate heart.<br>
        Away to the cheating world go you,<br>
        Where pirates all are well-to-do;<br>
        But I'll be true to the song I sing,<br>
        And live and die a Pirate King.<br>
             For I am a Pirate King!<br>
        And it is, it is a glorious thing<br>
        To be a Pirate King!<br>
             For I am a Pirate King!</p>
    <h6 class="name">EDI:</h6>         
    <p class="speech EDI">Let us gaily tread the measure,
        Make the most of fleeting leisure,
        Hail it as a true ally,
        Though it perish by-and-by.</p>
    <h6 class="name">ISA:</h6>
    <p class="speech ISA"> Oh, he will be here presently! Remember poor Papa is
        not as young as we are, and we came over a rather
        difficult country.</p>
