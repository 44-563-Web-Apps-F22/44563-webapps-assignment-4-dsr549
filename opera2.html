    <p class="speech KIN"> Oh, better far to live and die<br>
        Under the brave black flag I fly,<br>
        Than play a sanctimonious part<br>
        With a pirate head and a pirate heart.<br>
        Away to the cheating world go you,<br>
        Where pirates all are well-to-do;<br>
        But I'll be true to the song I sing,<br>
        And live and die a Pirate King.<br>
             For I am a Pirate King!<br>
        And it is, it is a glorious thing<br>
        To be a Pirate King!<br>
             For I am a Pirate King!</p>
    <h6 class="name">SAM:</h6>
    <p class="song SAM">For today our pirate 'prentice<br>
                 Rises from indentures freed;<br>
                 Strong his arm, and keen his scent is<br>
                 He's a pirate now indeed!</p>   
    <h6 class="name">KAT:</h6>   
   <p class="speech KAT">But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
                     alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
                     beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.</p>
